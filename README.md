# fÂµKanren

An extension of Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman's microKanren to allow reasoning on future values. This is done by implementing delayed streams (using Scheme promises) alongside immature and mature ones.

To understand the motivation, imagine we have a microKanren goal that refers to an external resource that can change over time, like a database. It would be nice to be able to reason both on current and future values, as in this simplified example.

```
(define db '(2 4))

(define (dbo v)
  (let loop ((db db))
    (cond ((null? db) (== #t #f))
          ((null? (cdr db)) (== v (car db)))
          (else (disj (== v (car db))
                      (loop (cdr db)))))))

(define results
  (run* (q)
    (fresh (a b)
      (== q `(,a ,b))
      (dbo a)
      (later (dbo b)))))
;; ==> #<promise>

(set! db '(3 5))

(future results)
;; => '((2 3) (2 5) (4 3) (4 5))
```

Here is a low-level example showing the interaction between promises, `conj` and `disj`.

```
(define (==later a b)
  (lambda (s/c)
    (delay
      ((== a b) s/c))))

(define empty-state '(() . 0))

((call/fresh (lambda (q) (disj (== q 4) (==later q 5)))) empty-state)
;; => ((((#(0) . 4)) . 1) . #<promise>)

(force (cdr ((call/fresh (lambda (q) (disj (== q 4) (==later q 5)))) empty-state)))
;; => ((((#(0) . 5)) . 1))      	

((call/fresh (lambda (q) (conj (== q 4) (==later q 5)))) empty-state)
;; => #<promise>

(force ((call/fresh (lambda (q) (conj (== q 4) (==later q 5)))) empty-state))
;; => ()
```

The macro `later` is defined to facilitate the creation of delayed goals, analogous to `Zzz`, and the utility functions `promised`, `future` and `current` help with the dotted-lists created by these promises. The miniKanren wrappers `run`, `run*`, `pull`, `take` and `take-all` are appropriately extended.

```
(define $0 (run* (q) (disj (== q 4) (later (== q 5)))))

$0
;; => (4 . #<promise>)

(current $0)
;; => (4)

(promised $0)
;; => #<promise>

(future $0)
;; => (5)
```

Disjunction is simple: in successive calls to `disj` or `mplus`, promises are shunted right and grouped together in a single promise.

```
;; equivalent

(disj (later (== #(0) 6)) (disj (== #(0) 5) (later (== #(0) 7))))

(disj (== #(0) 5) (later (disj (== #(0) 6) (== #(0) 7))))
```

Conjunction is a little more complicated as soon as we allow for recursive promises. In `(conj g1 g2)`, we want the promises created by g1 and g2 to be forced at the same time, while any recursive promises created by those two groups of promises to be delayed to yet a further time. Simultaneity between two delayed predicates is defined as being nested in an equivalent number of `delay`s.

```
(define $1
  (run* (q)
    (later (== q 4))
    (disj (later (later (== q 5)))
          (later (== q 4)))))

$1
;; => #<promise>

(future $1)
;; => (4 . #<promise>)

(future (future $1))
;; => ()

;; a bit impure...
(define (inco x)
  (let r ((n 0))
    (disj (== x n) (later (r (+ n 1))))))

(define $2
  (run* (q)
    (fresh (a b)
      (== (list a b) q)
      (conj (inco a) (inco b)))))

$2
;; => ((0 0) . #<promise>)

(future $2)
;; => ((0 1) (1 0) (1 1) . #<promise>)

(future (future $2))
;; => ((1 2) (2 0) (2 1) (2 2) (0 2) . #<promise>)

(future (future (future $2)))
;; => ((0 3) (2 3) (3 0) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3) (1 3) . #<promise>)
    
```
